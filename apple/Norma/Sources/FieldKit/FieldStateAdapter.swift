/// The ONLY new design in this transplant (everything else in `FieldKit/` is a direct v1 port).
/// A thin, v1-shaped facade over `SessionModel` so `NormaFieldView` (copied from v1
/// `GlassFieldView`'s composer path) can read exactly the surface v1's `AppState` used to
/// provide — `statusText`, `isThinking`, `visibleResponse`, a settable composer draft, and three
/// callbacks — without `NormaFieldView` knowing our session/event model exists at all. Every
/// place the copied view used to read `appState.X` now reads `adapter.X` (see `NormaFieldView`'s
/// header comment for the full read-by-read rebind list).
///
/// Task B is expected to either keep this adapter driving a live `SessionModel` (as constructed
/// here), or fold its logic directly into whatever wires `NormaFieldView` into the running app —
/// this file is deliberately small and boring so that swap is cheap either way.
