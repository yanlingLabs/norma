// (e.g. a handshake timeout, not just ENOENT) — that client is never inserted into `clients`
// below, so nothing else would ever reap it. `stop()` in the catch is what prevents the orphan.

   *
   *  The loop makes this robust to interleaving: awaiting an in-flight promise lets its `spawn()`
   *  insert a fresh `clients` entry (with a newly armed timer) between our snapshot and drain — the
   *  NEXT iteration finds and disarms that entry (client.stop() is idempotent, so the double stop
   *  is a no-op). It terminates because no `clientFor` runs during shutdown, so no NEW spawns
   *  start: `inFlight` strictly drains and `clients` grows by at most one entry per drained
   *  in-flight promise. Idempotent + safe under two concurrent stopAll calls (every delete/clear/
   *  stop is a no-op the second time). A wedged in-flight spawn is bounded by its own
